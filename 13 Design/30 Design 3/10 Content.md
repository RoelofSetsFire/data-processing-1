##  Problem 1: Rainbow color map
Find a rainbow color map visualization on the web (see [Reading 3] for reference). Please include a screenshot and link of the visualization.
Briefly summarize its intended objective and audience. Does it fail to successfully convey information? If so, why? Is there a good reason for this specific visualization to use a rainbow color scheme?


## Problem 2: Patterns and colors in maps
Patterns and colors are essential to maps. Compare a search for Harvard University on two interactive maps (e.g., Google Maps, Bing Maps, Yahoo! Maps, Apple Maps, map.harvard.edu). Answer the following questions, making references to concepts explained in Ware such as pattern recognition and properties of color. Please include screenshots of the examples you are comparing.

* Which map promotes an easier visual search for buildings?

* Which map more effectively visualizes routes from a random point A to point B?

* Which map is an overall better visualization, and why?


# Submit
* Push one pdf containing answers to problem 1 and 2 on Github. 
* Do not forget to put your names in the file!
* Cite the sources properly. 
* Indicate which text are quotes (by. e.g. italicizing text and using quotation marks).
