# Design workshop: Storytelling with data
Time: 10 hours

This is a group assignment and will be graded.
This week you will create a narrative supported by severeal visualisations on a relevant topic of choice.
This narrative has to be presented in a 3 minutes video.

Read the whole assignment and go trough the examples before you start!!

## Part 1: TOPIC

You have to choose a topic of your story. This should be some relevant news item.
You can choose from one of the following news items from Het Parool:

* [Aantal mensen met bijstand blijft groeien in Nederland]

* [Nieuwe hotels blijven maar komen in Amsterdam]

* [Amsterdam heeft hoog aantal laaggeletterden]



Or you can choose your own relevant news item, like:

* Zika virus

* doping scandals in sport

* refugee flow

* white Oscar's 'conflict'

* etc....


Don't forget to link to your idea source in your final presentation video.

## Part 2: DATA & THE NARRATIVE
 
You don't have to collect and process the data. However, make sure that you find some data sources to give you a feeling what is out there on the topic of choice. You might also want to compare/combine different (controversial/conflicting) news or data sources, to create a good twist to your story (refere to the talk of last week ([Alberto Cairo talk]) for inspiration).


Create an outline of your narrative. Think of a good catchy title. 
Think about the story you want to tell: who will be your audience, what will be the opening, what will be the conflict/climax, what are the consequences of the conflict? What are the insights your audience will remember?

Don't forget to link to your data sources in your final presentation video.


## Part 3: SKETCHING

Note: Sketch on paper!
Sketch the narrative of your story: opening, conflict, consequences.
Each part of your narrative should consists of a visualisation and may consists of text/icons/symbols.
Annotate all your visualisations to make them self explanatory. Sometimes the title will be sufficent, but at times you might want to add additional textual information or icons/symbols/etc. Don't forget the basic elements like axes, axes names, legend, title.
Each visual representation must be meaningful and all of them together must tell one story.


## Part 4: PRESENTING

Pitch your narrative supported by your sketches in a 3 minutes video. 
Your sketches should be visible and you should go through them telling the story. 
Here are some examples of presenting the story supported by the visualisations: 
* [Swine flu alert]
* [Crisis narrows China UK gap]
* [Storytelling by Robert Kosara]
* [Wealth Inequality in America]

Your task is really hard as you do not have real data nor real visualisations. But don't worry that unlike in the examples you do not have advanced and fancy graphics. Your task is to sell your potential story so that you can implement it in the future! 

You can choose between different formats of your presentation. It can either be just a screencast (of the static visuals) with recorded voice [Swine flu alert], or a (phone) recording of you telling the story infront of the board/paper with your visualisations [Storytelling by Robert Kosara], or a full presentation with animated/annotated visualisations and voice (tip for windows users: Camtasia Studio has a trail version that you can use for this) [Wealth Inequality in America]. 

And here are some tips on how to make a good pitch in 2-3 minutes: [Pitching your passion] 

Don't forget to link to the used sources in the video. You can either do it on the bottom of the screen, or add a slide with links at the end of the video (it can even be a recording of screen with text or a printed list).

## Submit
* Push your video and your sketch (pdf) on GitHub. 
* You can also submit a 1 page pdf with additional information on your narrative if you think it's necessary. 
However your 3 minutes pitch should be enough to sell your project.
* Is your video max. 3 minutes long? That is obligatory!
* Does your video contain links to: story source, possible data sources, any other sources of inspiration used?
