# Design workshop: Storytelling with data

This is a group assignment and will be graded.
This week you will create a narrative supported by severeal visualisations on a relevant topic of choice.
This narrative has to be presented in a 3 minutes video.

Read the whole assignment and go trough the examples before you start!!

## Part 1: DATA

You have to choose a topic of your story. This should be some relevant news item.
You can choose from one of the following news items from Het Parool:

* [Aantal mensen met bijstand blijft groeien in Nederland]

* [Nieuwe hotels blijven maar komen in Amsterdam]

* [Amsterdam heeft hoog aantal laaggeletterden]


Or you can choose your own relevant news item, like:

* Zika virus

* doping scandals in sport

* refugee flow

* white Oscar's 'conflict'

* etc....

Don't forget to link to your idea source in your final presentation video.
 
Make sure to include some twist to your story to make it interesting. You can achive this be combining different/conflicting data sources.

You don't have to collect and process the data. Make sure you find some data sources though that give you a feeling what is out there on the topic of choice. You might also want to compare/present different (controversial/conflicting) data sources, to create a good twist to your story (refere to the talk of last week ([Alberto Cairo talk]) for inspiration).
Always link to them in your final presentation video.

## Part 2: THE NARRATIVE

- think about a title
- think about the story you want to tell: who will be your audience, what will be the opening, what will be the conflict/climax, what are the consequences/insights of the conflict/climax?

Here normally comes the step where you would collect al your data (possibly from different sources), process it, and see what you can get out of it. I want you to imagine you have collected the data already and want to show it to the world. Proceed to the next step.

## Part 2: SKETCHING

sketch the narrative of your story: (opening, conflict, consequences)
Think that each visual representation must be meaningful and all of them together must tell one story.
Annotate your graphics!

## Part 3: PRESENTING

Pitch your story in a 3 minutes video. 
Your sketch should be visible and you should go through it telling the story. 
Here are some examples of explaining the visualisations: [1], [3], [4], [5].
Your task is really hard as you do not have real data nor real visualisations. Don't worry that the talks from the examples have advanced graphics 
Therefore your story should contain the possible insights that your visualisation could provide. Be creative.

You can choose between different formats of your presentation. It can either be just a screencast (of the static visuals) with recorded voice [1], or a (phone) recording of you telling the story infront of the board/paper with your visualisations [4], or a full presentation with animated/annotated visualisations and voice (tip for windows users: Camtasia Studio has a trail version that you can use for this) [5]. 

And here are some tips on how to make a good pitch in 2-3 minutes: [Pitching your passion] 

Don't forget to link to the used sources in the video. You can either do it on the bottom of the screen, or add a slide with links at the end of the video (it can even be a recording of screen with text or a printed list).

## Submit
* Push your video on GitHub. You can also submit a 1 page pdf with additional information on your narrative if you think it's necessary. 
However your 3 minutes pitch should be enough to sell your project.
* Does your video contain links to: story source, possible data sources, any other sources of inspiration used?
