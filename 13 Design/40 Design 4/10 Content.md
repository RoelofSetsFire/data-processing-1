# Design workshop

This is a group assignment and will be graded.

## Problem 1: Design critique group reflection

Take your analysis and ideas from the design critique of last week and discuss them with your group ([Confluence by Harshawardhan Nene and Kedar Vaidya]).
* Can you find a consensus? 
* Prepare one documents in which you in detail critique the visualisation as a group (max 2 pages). 
* Comment on the color and interaction aspects (according to [Reading 4] and [Reading 5]).
* Suggest improvements and refinements. 
* Use the provided list of questions/points [critique.pdf] to help you structure your critique (not exhaustive, you can discuss more/other aspects if necessary). 


## Problem 2: Patterns and colors in maps
Patterns and colors are essential to maps. Compare a search for Harvard University on two interactive maps (e.g., Google Maps, Bing Maps, Yahoo! Maps, Apple Maps, map.harvard.edu). Answer the following questions, making references to concepts explained in Ware such as pattern recognition and properties of color. Please include screenshots of the examples you are comparing.

* Which map promotes an easier visual search for buildings?

* Which map more effectively visualizes routes from a random point A to point B?

* Which map is an overall better visualization, and why?

## Problem 3:
Find a multiple linked views visualisation on the web (see [Reading 5] for reference). Please include a screenshot and link of the visualization. Briefly summarize its intended objective and audience. Discuss all the interactive elements and their role in the chosen visualisation.

# Submit
* Push one pdf containing answers to problem 1, 2 and 3 on Github. 
* Do not forget to put your names in the file!

* This is a group assignment and will be graded.
