# Design 2

## Problem 1: Design critique 
In this assignment you will critique a visualization and identify design
elements of visualizations that support analysis and communication: 

* [The Ebb and Flow of Movies]

Take 10-15 minutes to examine the visualization on your own and only then discuss it with your group.
By the end of the activity you should feel ready to share your observations and questions
in class and on paper!
Prepare one document in which you in detail critique the visualization as a group (max 2 pages). 
Use the provided list of questions/points [critique.pdf] to help you structure your critique (not exhaustive, you can discuss more/other aspects if necessary). 

Questions for discussion in class:

* Who is the intended audience?
* What tasks does the visualization enable?
* What data is represented in this visualization? Be specific.
* How is each data type visually encoded?
* How do the visual elements and user interactions support the tasks?
* Why do you like / dislike this visualization?

## Problem 2: Questions corresponding to the readings

Find a visualization not discussed in class or used in a homework and answer the following questions pertaining to that visualization. Attach the visualization as a screenshot in your submission.

* Consider Bertin's characterization of visual variables (position, size, shape, value, color, orientation, and texture). Pick 2 of Bertin's visual variables, and discuss them in relation to your visualization.

* Ask yourself what the designer is trying to convey and think of three to four possible tasks this visualization should help you with. Does the visualization achieve any of your tasks? (To view an example, see Albert Cairo, pages 26-Â­28.)
