# HTML and CSS

In this homework, you will begin working with HTML/CSS. This homework comes with supplementary files which you can download
[here](hw5files.zip).

## Introduction

Read Lessons 1--3 from "A Beginner's Guide to HTML & CSS" by Shay Howe:

* [Lesson 1: Terminology and syntax](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/terminology-syntax-intro)
* [Lesson 2: Elements and semantics](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/elements-semantics)
* [Lesson 3: Box model and positioning](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/box-model)

Briefly answer the following questions in `htmlcss.pdf`. A sentence or two
for each question will suffice.

1. At a high level, what is the purpose of HTML and CSS? How do the two differ?

2. What is the purpose of assigning a "class" to an HTML element? What is the
   difference between a "class" and an "id"? How would one select a division (div)
   element with class "box" using CSS?

3. List 5 different HTML elements and provide a short description of the
   function of each.

4. What is the difference between margin and padding?

5. Consider the Gmail Inbox interface. How is the site functionally divided?
   Create a nested list representing this functional division. Don't worry about
   extremely fine details; this should help you start:

        page
          top bar
            links to various Google sites
		  header bar
            left side
			  Google logo
			  search bar
			  search button

## Implementing a Layout

It's time to start working with HTML and CSS! Your task is to
choose a website and reimplement a basic, non-functional version of its user
interface (i.e., its aesthetic appearance). You are welcome to choose Gmail, or
you may choose another website that is of similar visual complexity (e.g., a
Wikipedia article). Your implementation need not be functional in any
way (buttons must not be clickable, search bars must not work, there must not
be dynamically loaded data, etc.), and you do not need to worry about images.
The intention of the task is simply to familiarize yourself with HTML and CSS,
particularly with respect to positioning elements on the page.

In terms of detail, don't worry about implementing every last visual element
and replicating the site exactly - just be sure to implement all major details
(e.g. approximate placement, colors, etc.) and show that you understand how to
position and format elements as necessary. For data that is normally dynamic
(e.g., the list of emails in the Gmail Inbox), just include a few static
examples by hard-coding them into your HTML.

You should submit two files for this problem in a folder called website:
index.html and style.css (make sure your HTML file correctly links to your CSS
file!). We have included two sample files - sample_index.html and
sample_style.css - which you may use as templates if you wish. Make sure to
validate your HTML with <http://validator.w3.org/> and your CSS with
<http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator>.

Many external resources are also available to help you. Especially if you
haven't worked with HTML and CSS before, you are encouraged to skim through the
other Lessons of "A Beginner's Guide to HTML & CSS" (see Problem 2) for
sections that may be of use. w3schools.com also provides extensive
documentation of HTML elements, CSS properties, etc.

## Submit instructions
