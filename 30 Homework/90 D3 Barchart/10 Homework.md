# Interactive barchart with D3
This week you will implement an interactive barchart and an interactive map using D3. Note that you are not allow to use any other libraries then D3.

For this part of the assignment you will use the files that you prepared last week.
Read [Part 3] of the barchart tutorial (you might want to read [Part 2] of this tutorial as well, if you haven't done so yet) and reproduce the barchart using your own data that you prepared last week.
As for interaction, your bars should change color while hovering over them (just like in the example in [Part 3]).
Additionally you should display the data value for the chosen bar above it (on mouse hover). You can either just print the text or use a d3-tip.

Update your completed files in a folder `Barchart`: `barchart.html` , `barchart.js` and
`barchart.css`.  Note that you may not need `barchart.css` here unless you
would like to change additional styling with regard to text, margins, etc.


## Submit instructions

1. Push the following into your D3 folder on GitHub:
   * 1: `barchart.html`, `barchart.css`, and `barchart.js`, contained in a folder `Barchart`
   * 2: D3 library, if linked to a local copy.
