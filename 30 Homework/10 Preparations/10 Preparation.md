# Preparations

Welcome to Data Processing. In this class, we will be using a variety of tools
that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes
smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority of those tools in this
homework. While some of this will likely be dull, doing it now will enable us
to do more exciting work in the weeks that follow without getting bogged down
in further software configuration. This homework will not be graded and this
homework has no group reflection phase, however it is essential that you
complete it timely since it will enable us to set up your accounts. You do not
have to hand anything in.

We will be using Python as our language of choice in this class. For those of
you unfamiliar with it, we will be introducing python and the pattern library
in the first two labs.

In the meantime, feel free to browse the language’s vast documentation and
tutorials. This problem will point you at how to set up Python and give you a
hint of what’s to come.
