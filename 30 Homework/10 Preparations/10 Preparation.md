# Preparations

Welcome to Data Processing. In this class, we will be using a variety of tools
that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes
smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority of those tools in this
homework. While some of this will likely be dull, doing it now will enable us
to do more exciting work in the weeks that follow without getting bogged down
in further software configuration. This homework will not be graded and this
homework has no group reflection phase, however it is essential that you
complete it timely since it will enable us to set up your accounts. 

## Github

First you will learn how to get started with Git in order to submit your homeworks.
Please refer to this GitHub manual [Github_manual.pdf] and answer the questions before proceeding with this homework.
Structure your repository as follows: make two folders *Homework* and *Design*. In each folder you will weekly make a new folder with a week number and put your documents from that week in there. Specific instructions on what should be committed each week are to be found in the assignments description.
Please __submit the URL of your repository__ underneath on this page.

## Text editor and console

Those of you who have followed Programming 1 and 2 are used to working with CS50's IDE. In this course we remove those training wheels. 
This means you have to download and install a text editor on your own computer. Which text editor depends on your operating system and interface preference. Free text editors that use colors to highlight your code are for example [Sublime Text 2]  limitless trial for Windows/Mac/Linux) or [Notepad++].
Besides a text editor you will also need to work with the command prompt or terminal. For Windows, type 'cmd' in the search bar if you don't know where to find it. For Mac, type 'terminal'.
