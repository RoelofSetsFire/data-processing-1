# Javascript

The homework for week 4 and 5 can be found in this [reader].
It contains the assignments about JavaScript. JavaScript is the only programming language that is supported by
all modern web browsers and it is the least intrusive way of adding 
interactive elements to a web page as it requires no plug-ins or other
special extensions. We will be using JavaScript to implement a number of
interactive visualizations.

For this course we will be using the book [Eloquent JavaScript] by 
Marijn Haverbeke. This book assumes very little programming background but
goes into sufficient detail for our purposes. It is furthermore available
freely from the publisher's web site. 

Modern web browsers support two ways of creating graphics, the 
canvas-element provides raster graphics and Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVG) provide vector graphics. Raster graphics are specified as
a grid of colored image elements and vector graphics are specified as
a collection of shapes. Raster graphics become blurry (or show large
pixels) when they are enlarged while vector graphics remain sharp. We will
use both techniques to create visualizations.
