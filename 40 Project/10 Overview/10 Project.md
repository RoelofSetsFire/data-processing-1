## Introduction

The data toolkit track consists of *data-processing* and *data project*
courses. This page describes the data project course, which you can only take
after having finished the data-processing course. During this course you will
use your knowledge of good visualization practices and programming skills to
construct a visualization for the web. You will keep track of your progress 
towards this end goal in a process book. 


## Data source and process

You are invited to work on a data set of your choosing, as long as it allows
a visualization of sufficient complexity to be created. Possible data sets
include those gathered from the Internet by scraping or crawling as was 
covered in the data-processing course, but can also be from your field of 
study. Past projects have used data from a physics experiment, movie 
box office results, Bitcoin valuations, and the transfers in the Dutch
soccer competition.


## The process

To guide you during the creation of your web visualization we will follow
the visualization process described in the lectures for the data-processing
course. This project will exercise your knowledge of good visualization
design and programming skills needed to create them.

So following Pfister's [lecture][1] about the visualization process you will
go through the following steps:

>    1. Target
>       1. Choose a specific domain of interest
>       2. define research question(s)
>       3. find and clean the data
>
>    2. Translate
>       1. Formulate the data analysis tasks (informed by research question)
>       2. Exploratory data analysis, first do this looking at the data with
>          some plotting tools
>       3. transform / summarize (computer statistics)
>
>    3. Sketch
>       1. design visual encodings
>       2. design interactions
>       3. sketch many ideas
>
>    4. Implement
>       1. use 'code' sketches (iterate)
>       2. define data structures
>       3. find efficient algorithms
>
>    5. Validate
>       1. is the abstraction right
>       2. does it support the tasks?
>       3. does it provide new insights?

As an aside: the process might not be as linear, as is documented in the
paper by [Munzner][2].

You will be documenting your progress in a so-called process book. This book
is a log of all the steps you went through to create the visualization. It is
important that this book also documents the design and implementation choices
you made. Note that this process book is one of your project's deliverables
and will count towards your final grade.


## Deliverables

- Project plan to be handed in the second week of the course (will not be
  graded, but must be present).
- A working web visualization, built using client-side techniques working in
  at least one current generation browser (Chrome or Firefox are recommended).
  This visualization must also include a story telling aspect.
- A process book describing what went in to the creation of your visualization.
- A short final presentation / demo of your web visualization.

For more information see the project [deliverables page][3].


## Schedule

While the schedule is still being fixed, it will include a weekly meeting
during block 5 (April and May 2014). Rough outlines of these meetings are
provided below:

- Monday March 31 12:00-13:00, Meeting 1: Introduction, explanation of project goals and deliverables.
- Monday April 7, 12:00-13:00, Meeting 2: Plenary session focused on data set choices, project plan
  deadline.
- Monday April 14, 12:00-13:00, Meeting 3: Plenary session,
- Monday April 28, 12:00-13:00, Meeting 4: Informal project presentations (used to collect early feedback).
- Monday May 12, 12:00-13:00,  Meeting 5: Plenary session.
- Monday May 17, 12:00-13:00, Meeting 6: Demo day / Final presentations.
