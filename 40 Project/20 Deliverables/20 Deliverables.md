## 0. Project plan

Before starting the design and implementation process you have to submit
a project proposal. This proposal should give a short description of the
data you are interested in using and what type of visualization you 
intend to create with it. Try to anticipate problems that may arise in
the implementation of your visualization and how you can overcome them. 

The project proposal is due in the second week of the project, at which
point you will get feedback and most likely the go-ahead to move to the
actual design and implementation process. The project plan will be an
appendix to your report, this version of the project plan should
incorporate also the feedback you received (it is in the final report
only for reference).

## 1. Web visualization

The data visualization project has the goal of creating an interactive
visualization for the web, based on a research question and data you
are free to choose. The visualization should be of sufficient complexity
to show of your knowledge of the visualization design and implementation
process. The visualization should be implemented using client side 
techniques (such as HTML / CSS / Javascript / D3). The visualization 
should also include a story telling aspect. 

* Sufficient complexity (*judged before starting the design process*)
* Works on one of the following browsers: Firefox, Safari or Chrome. If your
  implementation works across all modern browsers that is a definite plus.
* Visualization is implemented using client-side techniques, the code is
  readable.
* The product embodies good visualization practices.
* The visualization has a story telling aspect.


## 2. Process book (*the report*)

The project book has two goals. The first goal is to serve as documentation
to your visualization and a description of the process you went through to
implement it. As such it will also help in grading your visualization. The
secondary goal is help guide the process of implementation. It is strongly
suggested that you keep notes from the start of the data project course and
work them into your process book (and *not* write it all at the very end 
defeating its secondary purpose).


### Suggested contents

1. Introduction, that describes how and why you came to the choice of
   your data set. It should also give a description of what to expect
   in the rest of the report. You should also mention visualizations that
   inspired you here.

2. A description of the problem domain and the central research question
   you want to tackle with a visualization. Also describe your data source
   and any data collection / cleaning steps you undertook. The **target**
   step from Pfister's lecture on the design and implementation process.

3. A chapter that describes how you translated the research question in terms
   of the problem domain into the terms of computer science. This chapter
   should describe the **translate** step in the design and implementation
   process. Describe the tasks of your visualization (in computer science
   terms, see Munzener's paper), describe any exploratory data analysis you
   did (include plots made with tools like Tableau, if any) and describe any
   data transformations you performed.

4. A chapter with design sketches, these sketches should show the visual
   encodings and interactions you want to implement. Give a short description
   of the final sketches. This corresponds to the **sketch** step, it is
   understood that the final visualization may come out differently than the
   initial design. 

5. A chapter describing the **implementation** choices you made. What data
   structures did you use and why? What algorithms did you use? Describe the
   process of implentation, you can include versions you did not end up using
   if you explain *why* you chose not to use them.

6. A chapter on the **validation** of your visualization. Does your visualization
   answer the research question? Does your visualization embody good practices?
   What would you change in a new version of the visualization? Could it be
   extended? Etc. refer to the Munzener paper for more ideas. Be sure to
   revisit your research question and see whether you answered it.

7. As an appendix, your project plan.


## 3. Project presentation

The final presentation is an opportunity to show off your visualization in the
most positive light. The presentation should explain your design and
implementation process. You can then demonstrate your visualization and explain
its features. Finally you should reflect on the whole process and discuss your
results and what the lessons are.
