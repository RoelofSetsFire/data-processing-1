# Design Critique 1

In this activity, you will critique a visualization and identify design
elements of visualizations that support analysis and communication. By the end
of the activity you should feel ready to share your observations and questions
with the class.

In your breakout group, use the following visualization for your design critique: http://nyti.ms/1OUa2g

* What data is represented in this visualization? Be specific.
* How is each data type visually encoded?
* How do the visual elements and user interactions support the tasks?
* Why do you like / dislike this visualization?
