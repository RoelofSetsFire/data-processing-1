Questions for discussion:

* Who is the intended audience?
* What tasks does the visualization enable?
* What data is represented in this visualization? Be specific.
* How is each data type visually encoded? What are the interactions?
* How do the visual elements and user interactions support the tasks?
* Why do you like / dislike this visualization?
