## Questions

1. Pick three concepts covered in Lecture 9 - Interaction (e.g., Brushing & Linking) and relate them to the taxonomy presented in Heer & Shneiderman Table

    1. How do the interaction concepts fit to their taxonomy?

2. Cockburn et al. describe various interface design paradigms, among them the “fisheye view.” How would the fisheye view improve the usability of a visualization, and under what circumstances might it not?
