## Questions

1. According to Bostock et. al., what are the primary advantages of D3? Based
on your reading of the article, please provide an example of a type of
visualization that would be easier and better implemented in D3 as opposed to
HTML5, JSON, and Javascript. Please list the pros and cons of choosing D3 over
pure HTML5, JSON and Javascript.

2. Of the visualization figures presented in Heer et. al., which do you find
the most difficult to comprehend? Does the complexity of the figure interfere
with the goal of visualization as described in the article? Include a
screenshot of the figure you have chosen in your response and use principles
that you have learned so far (i.e., from design, perception, and cognition) to
justify your choice.

3. Play around with the interactive graphs included in the Heer article. You
need to open this page in a browser that runs Java. Focus on Figure 1A. To what
extent do interactivity and transitions, elements that D3 optimizes, add to the
clarity and message of the visualization? With the element of interactivity in
mind, redesign and sketch the contents of figure 1A with one of the other
visualization types described in the Heer article. Include a picture of a
sketch of your idea, and describe how it supports comprehension and data
exploration.
