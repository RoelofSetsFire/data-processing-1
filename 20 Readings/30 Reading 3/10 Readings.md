## Questions

1. Ware describes bottom up and top down processing of visual information in
   the brain. Give a concrete and detailed example of how bottom up processing is
   influenced by top down processing, leading to a potentially wrong
   interpretation of "reality" by the viewer. Your example can include a
   screenshot, photo, or web site URL to refer to the scene that is being viewed.

2. In the Polaris paper, carefully read section 7.1 Scenario 1: Commercial
   Database Analysis on p. 62 again and examine Figure 6. Describe the visual
   mappings and visual queries, as mentioned earlier in the article, that Polaris
   enables in this series of screenshots.

3. Go to the Many Eyes website and browse around the visualizations. Click
   through a few and look at the comments. How successful do you think Many Eyes
   has been in achieving its original design purpose according to the paper? What
   do you think is the biggest issue/flaw with Many Eyes? What improvements might
   you suggest to Many Eyes to address these issues/flaws?
