## Questions

1. Ware argues that human perception involves 2.5 dimensions. Given this
   assertion, when might a 3D visualization be useful and why?

2. In Chapter 6, Ware presents some implications of pattern recognition and
   visual working memory on design. Provide an example that harnesses some of
   these principles (perhaps an advertisement, visualization, or interface) and
   discuss how the design takes these principles into account. Please include a
   screenshot, photo, or website URL.

3. Pick three concepts covered in Lecture 9 - Interaction (e.g., Brushing &
   Linking) and relate them to the taxonomy presented in Heer & Shneiderman Table
   1. How do the interaction concepts fit to their taxonomy?

4. Cockburn et al. describe various interface design paradigms, among them the
   “fisheye view.” How would the fisheye view improve the usability of a
   visualization, and under what circumstances might it not?
