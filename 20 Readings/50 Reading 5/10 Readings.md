## Questions

1. Ware argues that human perception involves 2.5 dimensions. Given this assertion, when might a 3D visualization be useful and why?

2. In Chapter 6, Ware presents some implications of pattern recognition and visual working memory on design. Provide an example that harnesses some of these principles (perhaps an advertisement, visualization, or interface) and discuss how the design takes these principles into account. Please include a screenshot, photo, or website URL.

3. According to Bostock et. al., what are the primary advantages of D3? Based on your reading of the article, please provide an example of a type of visualization that would be easier and better implemented in D3 as opposed to HTML5, JSON, and Javascript. Please list the pros and cons of choosing D3 over pure HTML5, JSON and Javascript.

4. Of the visualization figures presented in Heer et. al., which do you find the most difficult to comprehend? Does the complexity of the figure interfere with the goal of visualization as described in the article? Include a screenshot of the figure you have chosen in your response and use principles that you have learned so far (i.e., from design, perception, and cognition) to justify your choice.

3. Play around with the interactive graphs included in the Heer article. You need to open this page in a browser that runs Java. Focus on Figure 1A. To what extent do interactivity and transitions, elements that D3 optimizes, add to the clarity and message of the visualization? With the element of interactivity in mind, redesign and sketch the contents of figure 1A with one of the other visualization types described in the Heer article. Include a picture of a sketch of your idea, and describe how it supports comprehension and data exploration.
