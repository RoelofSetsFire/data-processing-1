## Questions

1. Find a visualization not discussed in class or used in a homework and answer the following questions pertaining to that visualization. Attach the visualization as a screenshot in your submission.

2. Consider Bertin's characterization of visual variables (position, size, shape, value, color, orientation, and texture). Pick 2 of Bertin's visual variables, and discuss them in relation to your visualization.

3. Munzner proposed a nested model for visualization design and validation. Discuss/validate your visualization with respect to domain problem characterization and data/operation abstraction design.

4. Based on Cleveland and McGill’s results, does your visualization embody good practices (i.e. can people accurately perform the tasks based on the encodings?)

5. Do you agree that visualization is a functional art? Explain.

6. Ask yourself what the designer is trying to convey and think of three to four possible tasks this visualization should help you with. Does the visualization achieve any of your tasks? (To view an example, see Albert Cairo, pages 26-­28.)
