## Questions

Find a visualization not discussed in class or used in a homework and answer
the following questions pertaining to that visualization. Attach the
visualization as a screenshot in your submission.

1. Consider Bertin's characterization of visual variables (position, size,
   shape, value, color, orientation, and texture). Pick 2 of Bertin's visual
   variables, and discuss them in relation to your visualization.

2. Munzner proposed a nested model for visualization design and validation.
   Discuss/validate your visualization with respect to domain problem
   characterization and data/operation abstraction design.

3. Based on Cleveland and McGill’s results, does your visualization embody good
   practices (i.e. can people accurately perform the tasks based on the 
   encodings?)

4. Do you agree that visualization is a functional art? Explain.

5. Ask yourself what the designer is trying to convey and think of three to
   four possible tasks this visualization should help you with. Does the
   visualization achieve any of your tasks? (To view an example, see Albert 
   Cairo, pages 26-­28.)
