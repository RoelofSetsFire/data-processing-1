## Questions

1. Find a rainbow color map visualization on the web. Please include a screenshot and link of the visualization.

    1. Briefly summarize its intended objective and audience. Does it fail to successfully convey information? If so, why? Is there a good reason for this specific visualization to use a rainbow color scheme?
