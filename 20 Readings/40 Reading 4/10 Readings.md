## Questions

1. Patterns and colors are essential to maps. Compare a search for Harvard
   University on two interactive maps (e.g., Google Maps, Bing Maps, Yahoo! Maps,
   Apple Maps, map.harvard.edu). Answer the following questions, making references
   to concepts explained in Ware such as pattern recognition and properties of
   color. Please include screenshots of the examples you are comparing.

    a. Which map promotes an easier visual search for buildings?
    b. Which map more effectively visualizes routes from a random point A to point B?
    c. Which map is an overall better visualization, and why?

2. Find a rainbow color map visualization on the web. Please include a
   screenshot and link of the visualization.

   a. Briefly summarize its intended objective and audience. Does it fail to
      successfully convey information? If so, why? Is there a good reason for this
      specific visualization to use a rainbow color scheme?
   
   b. Propose an alternative color scheme to replace the rainbow color map.
