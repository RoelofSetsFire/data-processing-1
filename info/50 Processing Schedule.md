This schedule is for students taking the Data Processing part of the Data
toolkit course in block 4 of the second semester (2013-2014).
The are two moments each week that you are expected to attend in person, the
reading group meetings and the design critique meetings. The former is to 
make sure that everyone stays on schedule and to have an opportunity to 
discuss that week's lectures and readings. The latter to serve as an 
opportunity to critically discuss visualizations, what makes them work (or
not).
