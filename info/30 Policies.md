# Course Policies

## Collaboration policy

Because teamwork is stressed in this class, collaboration, consulting
information sources, and working with others is permitted. Please note the
following restrictions, however.

On the homework solutions you must list any help or hints you have received
from others. Extensive collaboration (that is, solving the problem set with
others) before the group reflection phase is not permitted.

You may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have
submitted or will submit to another. Nor may you provide or make available
solutions to homeworks to individuals who take or may take this course in the
future.

## Quoting sources

You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning
the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You
can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or
libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. However,
you are encouraged to use libraries, unless explicitly stated otherwise!

You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided its
license allows you to re-use it. You must quote the source using proper
citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL) both in the source code and
in any publicly visible material. You may not use existing complex combinations
or large examples. For example, you may not use a ready to use multiple linked
view visualization. You may use parts out of such examples.

## Missed activities and assignment deadlines

The data processing course consists of several parts: the reading assignments and the questions that go with them and
normal homework assignments. Attendence is required at the reading sessions and the lab sesssions. 
The absence at the reading session results in missed opportunity to submit the accompanying assignment.  
Homework is to be handed in according to the [schedule], you are
allowed one slipped deadline.

If circumstances force you to miss a reading group meeting, a lab
session or a homework deadline be sure to mention this to the instructors 
ahead of time, use our [email]. Feel free to discuss any issues that come up 
(you may be referred to our coordinator).

## Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. If the course refers
some matter to the Examination Board, the course reserves the right to impose
local sanctions on top of that outcome for that student that may include, but
not be limited to, a failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.

In all cases we follow the directives regarding fraud and plagiarism of the
University of Amsterdam and of the examination board of the Computer Science
BSc programme. Find them here in [English] and [Dutch].
