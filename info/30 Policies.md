# Course Policies

## Collaboration policy

Because teamwork is stressed in this class, collaboration, consulting
information sources, and working with others is permitted. Please note the
following restrictions, however.

On the homework solutions you must list any help or hints you have received
from others. Extensive collaboration (that is, solving the problem set with
others) before the group reflection phase is not permitted.

You may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have
submitted or will submit to another. Nor may you provide or make available
solutions to homeworks to individuals who take or may take this course in the
future.

## Quoting sources

You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning
the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You
can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or
libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. However,
you are encouraged to use libraries, unless explicitly stated otherwise!

You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided its
license allows you to re-use it. You must quote the source using proper
citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL) both in the source code and
in any publicly visible material. You may not use existing complex combinations
or large examples. For example, you may not use a ready to use multiple linked
view visualization. You may use parts out of such examples.

## Missed activities and assignment deadlines

The data processing course consists of several parts. The online video 
lectures, the reading assignments and the questions that go with them and
normal homework assignments. Attendence to the reading group meetings is
mandatory (you are allowed to miss 1 without sanctions), attendence to the
design critique sessions is also mandatory (and again you are allowed to
miss 1). Homework is to be handed in according to the [schedule], the 
homework can be handed in on thursday evening at the latest also referr
to the instructions about the formats that are allowed.

If circumstances force you to miss a reading group meeting, a design critique
session or a homework deadline be sure to mention this to the instructors 
ahead of time. Feel free to discuss any issues that come up.

## Homework formats

When handing in homework make sure to always do the following:

* For reports or answers to questions (both for the readings and the homework)
  hand them in as A4 sized PDF files. Include your name and student number on
  the top of the first page, and include a title that makes clear which 
  homework assignment / project proposals / project reports / reading it is
  about. When using Microsoft office export your document to PDF (or use the
  print to PDF function).

* For programs, include you name and student number in the a comment on top
  of each of the files you wrote. (Do not change external libraries that you
  use to include your name, obviously). Include all needed files into a zipfile
  or a tarball.

* For Javascript programs and webpages use local (and relative) links only. Do
  not link to a CDN (like Google's). 

* For webpages include your name and student number somewhere on the page (but
  well visible).


## Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. If the course refers
some matter to the Examination Board, the course reserves the right to impose
local sanctions on top of that outcome for that student that may include, but
not be limited to, a failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.

In all cases we follow the directives regarding fraud and plagiarism of the
University of Amsterdam and of the examination board of the Computer Science
BSc programme. Find them here in [English] and [Dutch].
