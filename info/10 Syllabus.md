# Data Processing

*Edition: February 2016, under construction*

The amount and complexity of information produced in science, engineering,
business, and everyday human activity is increasing at staggering rates. The
goal of this course is to expose you to visual representation methods and
techniques that increase the understanding of complex data. Good visualizations
not only present a visual interpretation of data, but do so by improving
comprehension, communication, and decision making.

In this course you will learn how the human visual system processes and
perceives images, good design practices for visualization, tools for
visualization of data from a variety of fields, collecting data from web sites
with [Python](http://www.python.org/), and programming of interactive web-based
visualizations using [D3](http://d3js.org/).

## Staff

The course's staff consists of your instructor and several student assistants.
Due to the size of the course, we can't usually respond to email inquiries
about your problem sets or organizational matters. You are encouraged to speak
to a student assistant or the instructor at the lab.

## Goals for this course

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to...

* Critically evaluate visualizations and suggest improvements and refinements
* Use Python and other tools to scrape, clean, and process data
* Use standalone visualization applications to quickly explore data
* Apply a structured design process to create effective visualizations
* Use principles of human perception and cognition in visualization design
* Create web-based interactive visualizations using Javascript and D3
* Conceptualize ideas and interaction techniques using pen and paper
* Use storytelling principles to design coherent and clear visualizations

## Prerequisites

You'll need programming experience in a language like C, Ruby or Python, an
understanding of object-oriented basics, experience with reading and writing
data files.

## Expectations

We require you to attend the weekly discussion meetings. We expect you to watch
all lectures in preparation of the meetings. We expect you to submit all
homework assignments, including answers to the reading questions.

## Grades

Participation in design critique, reading assignments, and programming homeworks and final written assignment will all be part of your final grade. Non-effort in any of these will lead to a failing grade for the course, regardless of compensation. But if you do the work and interact regularly with instructor and fellow students, you should be able to make it!

Grading specification:

* written individual assignments: pass/fail
* written group assignments: 35%
* programming homeworks: 65%

A student must ordinarily meet all deadlines in order to be eligible for a passing grade unless granted an exception in writing by the courseâ€™s instructor.
