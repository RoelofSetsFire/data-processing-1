# Course components

## Homework

The path to a good visualization design in your projects is likely to involve
mistakes and wrong turns. It is therefore important to recognize that mistakes
are valuable in finding the path to a solution, to broadly explore the design
space, and to iterate designs to improve possible solutions. Weekly homework is
going to provide an opportunity to learn these design skills and to test your
understanding of the material. The homework is designed to support you in
developing later projects.

## Homework formats

When handing in homework make sure to always do the following:

* The written assignments should be hand in as A4 sized PDF files. Include your name and student number on
  the top of the first page, and include a title that makes clear what the assignment is  about. When using Microsoft office export your document to PDF (or use the print to PDF function).

* For programs, include you name and student number in the a comment on top
  of each of the files you wrote. (Do not change external libraries that you
  use to include your name, obviously). Include all needed files into a zipfile
  or a tarball.

* For Javascript programs and webpages use local (and relative) links only. Do
  not link to a CDN (like Google's). 

* For webpages include your name and student number somewhere on the page (but
  well visible).

  
## Design part

In the design part of the course we'll dive into understanding what good visulisations are, what theoretical principles should be applyed and what good practices are for desiging a good visualisation.

There are reading assignments each week, scientific articles and chapters 
from the book *Visual thinking for design* by Colin Ware. The content of each
week's reading will be reflected in the assignment of that week.

To complete this part of the course, you will need to attend weekly workshop sessions, usually on Mondays at 11:00 (group B2) and at 13:00 (group B1). Some of the work will be done in class and there is regular sharing of work by way of informal presentations. 
All assignments are released on Mondays and are due next Monday, at 9:59 a.m.
You will be assigned to a group during the first workshop session and the assignments will be done in a group and presented by a group during the weekly workshops. Only the last design assignment is individiual. 

Topics by week are:

| week | topic                      | 
| ---: | -------------------------- | 
|    1 | design                     | 
|    2 | visual variables, color    | 
|    3 | process, cognition         | 
|    4 | interaction                | 
|    5 | networks & maps            | 
|    6 | storytelling           		|  

 

## Technical part

In the technical part of the course you will learn how to implement interactive web-based visualisations in javascript and D3.

This part consists first and foremost of a lot of programming work, done by you! 

Topics by week are:

| week | topic                           |  
| ---: | ------------------------------- |  
|    1 | Scraping IMDB                   | 
|    2 | Line graph in Javascript        |  
|    3 | SVG + JSON                      |  
|    4 | Intro D3 + interactive barchart |  
|    5 | Interactive map + Intro Line    |
|    6 | Multiseries interactive line    |
|    7 | Linked views                    |  

All assignments are released on Mondays and are due by Friday, at 23:59. All of these assignments have to be handed in individually, but you are supposed to help each other out generously during the course.

To assist you with programming the lab will be open on Wednesdays and Fridays between 11:00 and 15:00.
