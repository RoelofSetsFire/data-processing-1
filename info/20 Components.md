## Homework

The path to a good visualization design in your projects is likely to involve
mistakes and wrong turns. It is therefore important to recognize that mistakes
are valuable in finding the path to a solution, to broadly explore the design
space, and to iterate designs to improve possible solutions. Weekly homework is
going to provide an opportunity to learn these design skills and to test your
understanding of the material. The homework is designed to support you in
developing later projects.

## Homework formats

When handing in homework make sure to always do the following:

* For reports or answers to questions (both for the readings and the homework)
  hand them in as A4 sized PDF files. Include your name and student number on
  the top of the first page, and include a title that makes clear which 
  homework assignment / project proposals / project reports / reading it is
  about. When using Microsoft office export your document to PDF (or use the
  print to PDF function).

* For programs, include you name and student number in the a comment on top
  of each of the files you wrote. (Do not change external libraries that you
  use to include your name, obviously). Include all needed files into a zipfile
  or a tarball.

* For Javascript programs and webpages use local (and relative) links only. Do
  not link to a CDN (like Google's). 

* For webpages include your name and student number somewhere on the page (but
  well visible).

  
## Design track

*Only available in the February-March period.*

The first part of this course is the design track, where we'll dive into understanding what good visulisations are, what theoretical principles should be applyed and what good practices are for desiging a good visualisation.

There are reading assignments each week, taken from scientific literature and
from the book *Visual thinking for design* by Colin Ware. The content of each
week's reading assignment will be reflected in the assignment of that week.

To complete this part of the course, you will need to attend weekly workshop sessions, usually on Mondays at 13:00. Some of the work will be done in class and there is regular sharing of work by way of informal presentations. 
All assignments are released on Mondays and are due by Friday, at 23:59.
Some of the assignments have to be handed in individually, and other are handed in by a single representative per group. You will be assigned to a group during the first workshop session. 

Topics by week are:

| week | topic                      | 
| ---: | -------------------------- | 
|    1 | visual variables           | 
|    2 | design                     | 
|    3 | process                    | 
|    4 | color                      | 
|    5 | interaction                | 
|    6 | storytelling       		|  

 

## Technical track

*Available both in February-March and in April-May.*

The second part of this course is the technical track, where you will learn how to implement interactive web-based visualisations in javascript and D3.

This part consists first and foremost of a lot of programming work, done by you! 

Topics by week are:

| week | topic                           |  
| ---: | ------------------------------- |  
|    1 | Scraping IMDB                   |  
|    2 | Crawling                        |  
|    3 | Line graph in Javascript        |  
|    4 | SVG + D3 intro                  |  
|    5 | Scatterplot and barchart in D3  |  
|    6 | JSON + map in D3                |  
|    7 | Linked views in D3              |  

All assignments are released on Mondays and are due by Friday, at 23:59. All of these assignments have to be handed in individually, but you are supposed to help other students out generously during the course.

To assist you with programming, there will be an introductory meeting every Wednesday at 11:00 and the lab will be open on Fridays between 11:00 and 15:00.
