# Course components

## Video lectures

For the data processing course there are two video lectures per week. Students
are expected to watch these and take notes. The contents of the video lectures
will be treated during the reading group meetings (see below, and the [schedule]
for the exact dates). The class activities are designed to help you master the
relevant materials.

## Reading assignments

On top of the video lectures there are reading assignments each week that are
taken from scientific literature, and from the book *Visual thinking for
design* by Colin Ware. The contents of each weeks reading assignment will be
treated during that week's reading group meeting. The homework assignments will
contain questions about the mandatory readings. When answering those please be
brief and to the point!

## Reading group meetings and design critique sessions

To give you an opportunity to discuss the contents of each week's reading
assignment and video lectures a reading group meeting is organized each week.
Attendence to the reading group meetings is mandatory (you are allowed to 
miss one over the course of block 4). Discussing the readings and video
lectures should help in doing the homework.

The design critique sessions are organized each thursday to offer an opportunity
to discuss visualizations that are interesting. We will pick apart each 
visualization so that you may learn from them. Students are encouraged to
bring along visualizations they deem interesting.

## Labs

In the original course at Harvard, there are weekly lab sessions for students
to practice skills and get assistance with their visualizations. We have
replaced the guided practice sessions with specific materials to be able to
practice on your own. Other than that, we strongly recommend that you regularly
attend the lab to confer with the teaching assistant(s) and get help with your
assignments.

## Projects

In the original version of this course the projects are spread out over the
whole course. For the UvA the course is split in two: Data processing and
Data project. All three projects are part of the Data project course, and
it is recommended that you only start the Data project course after 
finishing the Data processing course.

The first project is an individual effort. For the second and third projects
you may work closely with another classmate in a **two-person project team**.
You can come up with your own teams and use Piazza to find prospective team
members. We recognize that individual schedules, different time zones,
preferences, and other constraints might limit your ability to work in a team.
If this the case, ask us for permission to work alone.

## Homework

The path to a good visualization design in your projects is likely to involve
mistakes and wrong turns. It is therefore important to recognize that mistakes
are valuable in finding the path to a solution, to broadly explore the design
space, and to iterate designs to improve possible solutions. Weekly homework
is going to provide an opportunity to learn these design skills and to test
your understanding of the material. The homework is designed to support you in
developing the projects. You should be able to benefit immensely from synergies!
